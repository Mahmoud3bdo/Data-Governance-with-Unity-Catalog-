# Data-Governance-with-Unity-Catalog

This project demonstrates how to use Unity Catalog to implement data governance in a data lakehouse. The project uses Databricks, Spark SQL, and Delta Lake to create a three-tier data lakehouse architecture with bronze, silver, and gold layers.

## Introduction
Data governance is the practice of ensuring that data is managed in a way that meets the needs of the organization. This includes ensuring that data is accurate, secure, and accessible to authorized users.

Unity Catalog is a data governance solution that provides a centralized view of data assets in a data lakehouse. Unity Catalog can be used to enforce data access control, track data lineage, and audit data usage.

## Features
This project demonstrates the following features of Unity Catalog:

- Data access control: Unity Catalog can be used to define fine-grained access control policies for data assets. This ensures that only authorized users can access data.
- Data lineage: Unity Catalog can track the lineage of data assets. This means that you can see how data flows through your data lakehouse and identify the sources of data.
- Data auditing: Unity Catalog can audit data usage. This means that you can see who has accessed data and when they accessed it.
Technologies
This project uses the following technologies:


- Databricks: Databricks is a cloud-based platform for data engineering and analytics.
- Spark SQL: Spark SQL is a SQL engine for Apache Spark.
- Delta Lake: Delta Lake is a data lake storage layer that provides ACID transactions, schema enforcement, and data lineage.
Usage


To use this project, you will need to have a Databricks account premium.
